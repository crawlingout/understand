        <h2>Quota for translations</h2>
        <p>
            This language learning tool needs to use a paid 3rd party service to translate words. I had to set up some limits for now. Currently, the quota is 4000 characters per month for each user.
        </p>

        <p>
            I need to figure out some way to finance it. Ads? Paid premium accounts with some fancy stuff like statistics of your most troublesome words and exporting your vocabulary to flashcards?
        </p>

        <p>
            Anyway, if you have run out of your quota for translations, please email me at <span id="r">jan at icanunderstand dot eu</span> and I will increase your quota. It's <strong>for free</strong>, at least while this app is still in beta.
        </p>
